# Introduction

Hi!

Welcome to my github profile.

I'm currently a 5th year PhD student in the Raushel lab at Texas A&M.  My thesis is primarily concenred with capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis in campylobacter jejuni.
My goal for this page is to learn more about coding and bioinformatics.  I have extensive wet-lab experience and I think that combining the practical skills I have developed over ther last decade with a deeper understanding of bioinformatics will make for some interesting code that might be useful to a large number of people. 

Outside of the lab I'm usually out camping and looking up at the stars. I dabble in a little amateur astronomy and astrophotography. I also really enjoy running and swimming.

If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via email: alexriegert (at) gmail (dot) com or on twitter: @ASterlingRieg 


Thanks for stopping by,
Alex Riegert
